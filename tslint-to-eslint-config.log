3 ESLint rules behave differently from their TSLint counterparts:
  * @typescript-eslint/no-unused-expressions:
    - The TSLint optional config "allow-new" is the default ESLint behavior and will no longer be ignored.
  * prefer-arrow/prefer-arrow-functions:
    - ESLint (eslint-plugin-prefer-arrow plugin) does not support allowing named functions defined with the function keyword.
  * @typescript-eslint/quotes:
    - Option "avoid-template" is not supported by ESLint.

1 rule is not known by tslint-to-eslint-config to have an ESLint equivalent:
  * tslint-to-eslint-config does not know the ESLint equivalent for TSLint's "completed-docs".
